TODO: implement the "min steps to capture" in an isolated way

QUESTION:

    borders = all touching neutral cells
    compute util for all borders
    borders_with_dirty_steps = all borders

    while !borders.empty:
        for u in borders_with_dirty_steps:
            recompute steps_to_capture(u)

        find border with max util/steps, u
        do u's steps
        for each site s used for u,
            see what other borders used s, add them to borders_with_dirty_steps

    ----

    subfuncs:
        steps_to_capture
            bfs, with "leaf-only move" logic

    structures needed:
        map from my sites -> [used:boolean, set<Int2> usingBorders]
        map from border to -> [util, steps]

new algo:
    for (dist = 1; true; dist++ ) {
        for each cell with dist:
            move = still
            if strength vs. production trade off is over threshold:
                if dist == 1:
                    move towards non-owned with highest attack_util
                else:
                    move towards owned with lowest move_cost
            else:
                move = still

            update map strengths based on move:
                if still:
                    src.str += src.production
                else:
                    if(dest.owner != src.owner) {
                        dest.str -= src.str
                        if(dest.str <= 0) {
                            dest.str = 0
                            dest.owner = me
                        }
                    }
                    else {
                        dest.str = min(255, src.str + dest.str)
                    }
                    src.str = 0
    }

    attack_util(site)
        return site.production

    move_cost(u, v)
        // this assumes you're moving because you want to go somewhere else, ie. v is not your final destination
        // thus, the opp cost is v.prod as well
        opportunityCost = u.prod + v.prod
        overflowCost = max(0, (u.str + v.str) - 255)
        return opportunityCost + overflowCost;
